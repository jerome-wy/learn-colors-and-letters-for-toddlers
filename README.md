### Description

I plan to build a Web Browser Game specifically for Toddlers. I have a toddler who LOVES to learn new things. Toddlers are surprisingly very intuitive when it comes to smartphones.

I thought it would be a great idea to make something for two things I love: my son and coding.

### How to get Started

The goal is to select the correct letter with its respective color.

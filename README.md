### Description

##### I plan to build a Web Browser Game specifically for Toddlers. I have a toddler who LOVES to learn new things. Toddlers are surprisingly very intuitive when it comes to smartphones. I thought it would be a great idea to make something for two things I love: my son and coding.

### How to get Started

#### Instructions
***This game is VERY simple!***

ToddLearn was designed for a small human to be able to play the game with no issues. Simply choose a Mode you would like to start with:
Letters: A random letter in the Alphabet will populate and the user must select the color it is.

Numbers: A random number between 1 - 100 will populate and the user must select the color it is.

Words: A random word will populate and the user must select the color it is.

Add a Word:
Press the Add Word button and type in a 3-Letter word that will join the game for you to select from!

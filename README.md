### Description

##### ToddLearn is a very simple game that I created for my own Toddler. Toddlers are so curious and always want to get into a phone or tablet. I thought it would be pretty cool to make a game specifically for him to play and learn at the same time.

### How to get Started

ToddLearn was designed for a small human to be able to play the game with no issues. Simply choose a Mode you would like to start with: Letters: A random letter in the Alphabet will populate and the user must select the color it is.
**Letters**:
A random letter in the Alphabet will populate and the user must select the color it is.

**Numbers**: A random number between 1 - 100 will populate and the user must select the color it is.

**Words**: A random word will populate and the user must select the color it is.

**Add a Word**: Press the Add Word button and type in a 3-Letter word that will join the game for you to select from!
